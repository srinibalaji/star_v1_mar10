# Sprint 1 Retrospective & Sprint 2 Resolution Q&A

**File:** `docs/SPRINT1_RETRO_QA.md`
**Date Updated:** 2026-02-28
**Owner:** Principal Architect (Amit)
**Purpose:** Tracking resolutions from the Feb 26 STAR Team Zoom session and aligning them with the Sprint 1 & Sprint 2 Terraform architecture updates.

---

## 1. Tagging & State Conflicts

**Q: Policy creation fails — resource in conflicted state (tag namespace exists).**

**Resolution: ✅ FIXED IN CODE**

The conflict originated in `mon_tags.tf`, where `oci_identity_tag_default` was incorrectly reusing `oci_identity_tag.owner.id` during creation. This caused the `Owner` tag to receive `${iam.principal.name}` at provisioning time and then be overridden by `lz_defined_tags` on apply — producing an inconsistent state cycle that ORM interpreted as perpetual drift.

The file was completely rewritten. Changes made:

- `DataClassification` tag added as a dedicated 5th tag (Classification: Official-Open / Official-Closed / Sensitive-Normal / Sensitive-High / Restricted).
- `oci_identity_tag_default` now correctly references `oci_identity_tag.data_classification.id`, with a static default value of `Official-Closed` (CIS 3.2 compliance).
- `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` applied to `oci_identity_tag_namespace.elz_v1` to prevent ORM from attempting to delete and recreate the namespace, which was the root cause of the conflicted-state error.

---

**Q: Tagging — Terraform implementation and design best practices (review with Global Architect Inderpal).**

**Resolution: ✅ IMPLEMENTED**

The baseline best practice is established. Tags are defined once at the Hub/Root level (`mon_tags.tf`) under the `C0-star-elz-v1` namespace. Three tagging layers are in effect across all resources:

- **Layer 1 (freeform):** `oci-elz-landing-zone`, `managed-by`, `sprint` — no dependencies, applied immediately.
- **Layer 2 (defined):** `C0-star-elz-v1.{Environment, Owner, ManagedBy, CostCenter}` — applied via `lz_defined_tags` local.
- **Layer 3 (tag default):** `DataClassification = Official-Closed` auto-applied at tenancy root via `oci_identity_tag_default` — no team action required, every new resource inherits it.

Teams do not need to write tag blocks on individual resources. `depends_on` is used where necessary to handle the OCI tag service's ~10-second propagation lag.

---

## 2. Variables, Naming & ORM UI

**Q: Global and local variable implementation and design best practices (Amit / Inderpal review).**

**Resolution: ✅ IMPLEMENTED**

Hardcoding is fully deprecated. All global routing names (e.g., `ew_hub_drg_name = "drg_r_ew_hub"`), base CIDR blocks, resource display names, DNS labels, and DRG attachment names are centralised in `locals.tf` and `variables_net.tf`. No resource file defines a string literal for any infrastructure name — all reference `local.*` constants. This ensures a single rename in `locals.tf` propagates everywhere automatically.

---

**Q: Naming consistency check — uppercase with underscores issue was present in module YAML and variables.**

**Resolution: ✅ FIXED & DOCUMENTED**

The naming standard documentation is now in `docs/` in the repository and is the single source of truth. The conventions in force are:

| Resource Class | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Compartments | `C1_<AGENCY>_ELZ_<FUNCTION>` | `C1_R_ELZ_NW` |
| Groups | `UG_[<AGENCY>_]ELZ_<FUNCTION>` | `UG_ELZ_NW`, `UG_OS_ELZ_NW` |
| Policies | `<GROUP_NAME>-Policy` | `UG_ELZ_NW-Policy` |
| VCNs | `vcn_<agency>_elz_nw` | `vcn_r_elz_nw` |
| Subnets | `sub_<agency>_elz_nw_<zone>` | `sub_os_elz_nw_app` |
| DRGs | `drg_r_<qualifier>` | `drg_r_hub` |
| Route Tables | `rt_<agency>_elz_nw_<zone>` | `rt_os_elz_nw_app` |
| Sim Firewalls | `fw_<agency>_elz_nw_sim` | `fw_os_elz_nw_sim` |
| Bastion | `bas_r_elz_nw_hub` | — |
| DRG Attachments | `drga_<agency>_elz_nw` | `drga_os_elz_nw` |
| Tag Namespace | `C0-<project>-elz-v<N>` | `C0-star-elz-v1` |

All 29 resource display-name constants in `sprint2/locals.tf` were programmatically validated against this convention — zero drift.

---

**Q: `schema.yaml` in ORM UI — one name per variable; tags in ORM should match universal tagging.**

**Resolution: ✅ FIXED IN CODE**

`schema.yaml` was fully audited. All four spoke VCN CIDR defaults were corrected from `/16` to `/24` to exactly match the Terraform `variables_net.tf` defaults. The ORM UI will now present values that are directly deployable without any manual correction. Defined tag keys in the ORM UI match the `C0-star-elz-v1` namespace exactly.

---

## 3. State Management & Tracking

**Q: Policy naming — must match Sprint 1 agreement. Move from Excel to JSON state ledger.**

**Resolution: ✅ CONFIRMED**

Excel tracking is officially deprecated. `sprint_state_ledger.json` was merged into the repository today and is the single source of truth for state sync across all teams. Policy names follow the `<GROUP_NAME>-Policy` convention and are validated against the ledger. The Sprint 1 stack contains 11 policy objects. SIM policies (`UG_SIM_EXT-Policy`, `UG_SIM_CHILD-Policy`) are Sprint 4 scope and are not in the Sprint 1 state.

---

**Q: ORM deletion of resources and drift — not caught for one team (Feb 26 Zoom session; workarounds from Amit and Wendy).**

**Resolution: ✅ MITIGATED**

`.gitignore` files have been added to both `sprint1/` and `sprint2/` directories, excluding `*.tfstate`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform/`, and `*.tfplan` from version control. This prevents local state files from overriding ORM remote state on the next plan. The specific drift anomaly from Feb 26 is still under investigation — TCE team has been asked to retrieve the ORM Job logs for the affected stack.

> **Standing action:** Do not run `terraform destroy` and re-apply to resolve drift. Contact the architect first so the drifted resource can be imported (`terraform import`) rather than recreated.

---

## 4. Sprint 2 Setup & Execution

**Q: Sprint 2 code scaffold needs updates per sprint schedule — must include VCNs, subnets, routing, and smoother validation.**

**Resolution: ✅ COMPLETED — Amit / Han Kiat Review**

The comprehensive audit branch was merged today. The scaffold now fully maps to the V1 Isolated Design:

- 5 VCNs (`vcn_r_elz_nw`, `vcn_os_elz_nw`, `vcn_ts_elz_nw`, `vcn_ss_elz_nw`, `vcn_devt_elz_nw`)
- 6 subnets (2 hub, 4 spoke app subnets)
- 2 DRGs in `C1_R_ELZ_NW`: `drg_r_hub` (active, 5 attachments in Phase 2) and `drg_r_ew_hub` (V2 placeholder, 0 attachments)
- 6 route tables — all spoke RTs updated in-place via dynamic `route_rules` block in Phase 2 (no subnet recreation)
- 4 Sim FW instances (hub, OS, TS, SS) — DEVT is network-only in V1
- 1 OCI Bastion Service (`bas_r_elz_nw_hub`) in hub MGMT subnet

All resources are parameterised. CIDR defaults in `variables_net.tf`, `locals.tf`, `schema.yaml`, and `terraform.tfvars.template` are fully consistent at `/24` for spokes.

---

**Q: Positive and negative validation tests via OCI CLI — not yet completed by teams.**

**Resolution: ✅ ACTIONED**

GitHub issues have been bulk-generated for the Sprint 2 board (StarPrj). Validation tasks TC-07 through TC-12b are mapped as explicit tickets for teams to execute via CLI post-deployment. The CLI commands are documented in `ARCHITECT_RUNBOOK.md`. TC-12b (E-W DRG exists) is a new test case added today alongside the `drg_r_ew_hub` resource.

---

**Q: Access policies, service gateways — reference link for teams to write their own blocks.**

**Resolution: ⏳ DEFERRED TO SPRINT 3**

Service Gateways are officially a Sprint 3 backlog item (Ticket `S3-ALL` created on the board). Teams should reference the standard OCI Terraform provider documentation for service gateway resource blocks: [registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/resources/core_service_gateway](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/resources/core_service_gateway).

---

## 5. Security & Auditing

**Q: Did Dawei ask for auditor/read role or full admin policy? (Clarified from Tuesday — SoD concern.)**

**Resolution: ✅ RESOLVED VIA SoD**

Dawei requires validation/auditor access, not administrative rights. During today's audit, a Separation of Duties (SoD) violation was identified: the Hub NW admin group (`UG_ELZ_NW`) had `manage virtual-network-family` in all four spoke compartments, which would allow the hub admin to modify spoke subnets and route tables directly.

This was downgraded to `read virtual-network-family` in `iam_policies_team1.tf` (pushed today). The SoD principle (A-06) is now enforced: each spoke team manages their own VCN exclusively via per-spoke policies (`UG_*_ELZ_NW-Policy`), while the hub admin has read-only visibility for validation and dashboard use. TC-03 verifies this boundary.

---

**Q: Cloud Guard Terraform enablement — to be confirmed (manually completed).**

**Resolution: ✅ ACKNOWLEDGED**

Cloud Guard was enabled manually in the tenancy. Importing it into Terraform state via `terraform import` will be evaluated in a future hardening sprint. No action required today.

---

## 6. Observability & Tracing of Terraform

**Q: Observability and tracing of Terraform implementation — best practices for resource conflicts, success, failures.**

**Resolution: ✅ DOCUMENTED**

Terraform observability is addressed at three layers:

**Layer 1 — ORM Job Logs (production):** Every ORM Plan and Apply job produces a full log accessible in OCI Console → Resource Manager → Stacks → Jobs. These logs capture resource creation order, API errors, conflict states, and timing. ORM retains job history indefinitely. For the Feb 26 drift anomaly, TCE team has been asked to retrieve these logs.

**Layer 2 — CI Pipeline Quality Gates (pre-production):** A comprehensive pipeline guide has been created at [`docs/terraform-pipeline-quality-gates.md`](terraform-pipeline-quality-gates.md). This covers `terraform fmt`, `terraform validate`, `tflint` (OCI ruleset), `checkov` (CIS OCI benchmark), `terragrunt` (DRY config and remote state), and `terratest` (integration testing). The guide includes GitHub Actions CI configuration that gates every PR with format, validate, lint, and security scan checks before code reaches ORM.

**Layer 3 — Drift Detection (ongoing):** Post-apply, run `terraform plan` (or ORM Plan) to detect drift. TC-06b (Sprint 1) and TC-17 (Sprint 2) are explicit zero-drift test cases. For production, schedule a weekly ORM Plan via the ORM API (`oci resource-manager stack create-plan`) with alerting on non-zero changes.

## 7. Board Definition & Cloud Testing Environment

**Q: Board definition, pre-validation, and cloud testing environment discussion.**

**Resolution: ✅ ACTIONED**

The GitHub Project Board (StarPrj) has been updated with Sprint 1 (S1-T1 to S1-T4) and Sprint 2 (S2-T1 to S2-T4) issues, each mapped to a team, file, and date. Validation test cases are tracked as separate issues (TC-01 through TC-19).

For cloud testing environment strategy: the current `deployment_identifier` variable (e.g. `C1`, `TEST`) allows multiple ELZ instances in the same tenancy without conflict. Each deployment creates its own compartment hierarchy. For formal pre-prod/prod separation, see Section 8 (Multi-Tenancy / Env Strategy) which is pending TCE/Paxton review. The `terratest` integration testing approach documented in [`docs/terraform-pipeline-quality-gates.md`](terraform-pipeline-quality-gates.md) provides automated apply/validate/destroy cycles against a dedicated test identifier.
